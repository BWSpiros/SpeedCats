# SpeedCat

#####Objective:
AA said that the best way to prep for the test was to redo Cats, so even with my philosophical objection to Cat-themed webapps I am redoing it. I started at 0210 this morning (currently 0400 exactly).

I am seeing if I can do the whole project in under 2 hours (I am using timey, I took a 20 minute break).
